## Reporting a Vulnerability

For most issues, GitHub Issues is a good enough place to explain the issue. Then many other people can potentially help as well. For extreme issues, emailing [security@khrysystem.dev](mailto:security@khrysystem.dev) works too, but please use good judgement on if it is really necessary to email.
